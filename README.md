What to do for web server getting too many 404 errors


If you look at your logs file sometime, you can see a lot of line with 404 errors initiated by the same IP adress. In addition, all requested URL are related to well know software like phpMyAdmin or other php coded applications. 

what does this mean ? 

This is the result of a script kiddy (but not only) searching for non patched app with security hole (may be an SQL injection for example).


What to do.

What to do against this peoples that use your bandwith without a good reason (on your point of view).

My ideas against this problem will be describe later in another document.
